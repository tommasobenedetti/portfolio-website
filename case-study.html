            sends information back and forward between a website/app and a user.<br><br>
            A REST API uses HTTP requests to receive, send, create, and delete data or files. In other words, via a REST
            API, a client is able to make changes to or access data from a database they otherwise wuoldn't have access
            to.

            <br>

            <h2 class="simplicity-left">MyFlix was the first website I've ever built. As it combines the backend with
                the client-side, it turned out to be a very challenging at the beginning. Nevertheless, as I got deeper
                into the project,
                I
                got more and more comfortable with it.</h2>
            <h2 class="simplicity-left">Apart from learning React, with its quirks and benefits, one of my favorite
                parts
                was
                using Postman. This is an incredible tool that allows you to test all the requests as if you were a user
                registering on the website, to be sure that all of them are functional. It worked as a perfect bridge
                between the backend and frontend.</h2>
            <br>
            <h2 class="simplicity-center-text">The excitement is real, I cannot wait to add more movies and directors to
                my
                website!</h2>
